## FSU R User Group

The FSU R Group is open to students, faculty, staff, alumni and general friends of Florida State University. (Being a member of the R group, makes you a friend, so really open to anyone.)

We meet to learn how to better use the R programming language (<https://cloud.r-project.org/>) for data analysis, statistical programming and other applications. We welcome people at all levels of experience.

## Mailing List and Canvas Site

### Canvas Site

Much of our material, including handouts and recordings of previous sessions are available through our canvas site. If you have an FSU ID, you can self-enroll though the following link:

[**https://fsu.instructure.com/enroll/AWFYCW**](https://fsu.instructure.com/enroll/AWFYCW)

If you do not have a current FSU ID (i.e., you are not currently faculty, staff, a student or visiting scholar), then send a note to the faculty leader, [Russell Almond](mailto:ralmond@fsu.edu) describing what you hope to accomplish with the R group and I will look into getting you an account.

### Mailing List

We also have a self-service mailing list for the R user group. You can enroll by going to <https://lists.fsu.edu/mailman/listinfo/epls-r-users>.

The mailing list is low volume, mostly announcements of group activities, although members are welcome to post R related questions to the list.

## Faculty Leader

The faculty leader for the FSU R group is Russell Almond. You can read more about him at his [home page](https://ralmond.net).  You can also see his [github](https://github.com/ralmond) and [R-Universe](https://ralmond.r-universe.dev) pages.
