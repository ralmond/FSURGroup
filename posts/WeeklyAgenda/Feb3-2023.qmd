We will start our exploration of *R for Data science* with Chapter 3, [Data Visualization](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html).

For this to work, we need volunteers to try the exercises. You don't have to succeed, but you should get far enough to get stuck in an interesting place, which we can discuss.

### Post your solutions

Post your solutions (or attempts) in Posit Cloud.

You can sign up for a free posit cloud account which allows us to share R code.
