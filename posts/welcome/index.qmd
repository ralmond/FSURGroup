The plan for 2023 is to do a self-study on the book

[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)

which is available online.

Each session, volunteers will present on the exercises in the book, and we will discuss some of the ideas.

We will also check in with some other projects that people might be working on, workshopping problems they are having.

In particular, I will present some of my ongoing work with data analysis for *Physics Playground*.
