(Being a member of the R group, makes you a friend, so really open to anyone.)\nWe meet to learn how to better use the R programming language (https://cloud.r-project.org/) for data analysis, statistical programming and other applications. We welcome people at all levels of experience."

    "text": "R is a free (both as in speech and as in beer) software package that allows for statistical analyses ranging from the simple to the complex, with support for great graphics.\nWe will be covering the R tidyverse series of commands which makes R easier to use for people with little programming experience. The text will be R for Data Science which is available for free at https://r4ds.had.co.nz/.\n\n\n\nMeetings Fridays at 3:45 in the LRC (Stone Building, 1301A).\nNo prior experience with R is necessary.\nSessions will be recorded so you can catch up if you miss a week.\nOpen to Grads, Undergrads, Faculty and Staff\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the LRC has computers available, you will probably want to install R on your own computer. Here are instructions for various kinds of computers.\nThere are three things you need to get: * R — this is the base program that does the calculations. * RStudio — this is a development environment which makes writing and running R scripts easier. It also has tools for building papers and presentations using R. * tidyverse — these are a series of packages which make the data analysis flow in R easier.\n\n\nThis is the source distribution. Select the installation method for your platform.\n\n\n\nUse the following command:\nsudo apt-get install r-base\nYou can also use sudo apt-get install rstudio to get RStudio.\n\n\n\nFirst, you need to configure the EPEL repositories. (In CentOS, this can be done with sudo yum install -y epel-release\nThen, you can install:\nsudo yum install -y R\n\n\n\nAssuming you have home brew installed, R can be installed using:\nsudo brew install r\nI think RStudio is available from homebrew, but I don’t know the recipe.\n\n\n\nAssumeing you have chocolatey installed, R can be installed using:\nchoco install r.project\nNote that you need to be running the powershell as admin to do installations with chocolatey.\nYou can also do choco install r.studio to get R Studio.\n\n\n\n\nRStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. That means it is a wrap around program that runs R inside it. At the same time it provides a number of tools to make working in R easier. These include:\n\nEditor for R code and scripts that is aware of R syntax.\nDebugging Tools\nWays of saving graphs and tables.\nIntegration with source code control systems (git and svn).\nA special way of writing reports and slides with integrated R code.\n\nThere are other IDEs for R, but this is the one we recommend. It is available from https://RStudio.com/.\n\n\n\nThe R system comes with the ability to add packages. There are 15,382 packages available for R, many of which are useful.\nThe tidyverse series of packages which make the normal data analysis flow work much more easily. These are used in the book we are following.\nTo install using RStudio: From the menubar select “Tools” followed by “Install Packages…”. Then type “tidyverse”. Make sure the “Install Dependencies” box is checked.\nTo install from the R command line, type install.packages(\"tidyverse\") then return. R will prompt for a mirror site to download from. All will work, but pick one in the US for fastest speed."

You can enroll by going to https://lists.fsu.edu/mailman/listinfo/epls-r-users.\nThe mailing list is low volume, mostly announcements of group activities, although members are welcome to post R related questions to the list."
